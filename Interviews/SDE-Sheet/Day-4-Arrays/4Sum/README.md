<details><summary>Optimal Solution</summary>

Optimal Solution: TC â‰ˆ `O(N ^ 3)`, SC = `O(1)`

* We do the same solution as the 2-sum albeit with some differences. <br>
* The array is 1st sorted. <br>
* Then, we perform the 2 pointer approach on the last 2 elements of the 4 elements and the 1st 2 elements are taken using nested loops. <br>
* The number of redundant quadruples are eliminated by using a while loop by skipping consecutive equal elements in each loop. <br>


Runtime: `114 ms`, faster than `41.48%`<br>
Memory Usage: `13.2 MB`, less than `49.83%`<br>
