Optimal Solution: TC = `O(logN)`, SC = `O(1)`

> We use the concept of *`Binary Exponentiation`*:

>> When the power is `odd`, we multiple our `answer with x`.
>> When the power is even, we multiple `x with x itself`.

`[NOTE: Take care of **integer overflows**, especially when the power is **odd**.]`
