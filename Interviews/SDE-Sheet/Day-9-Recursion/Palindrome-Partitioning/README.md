Optimal Solution 2: TC â‰ˆ `O((2 ^ N) * K * (N / 2))`, SC = `O(K * X)`

* We need to partition the string at every interval where the interval is a palindrome. <br>
* We need to do this recusively till we can't make any more partitions. <br>
* If the last partition we made is done on the last index, we put all the partitions in our answer vector. <br>
