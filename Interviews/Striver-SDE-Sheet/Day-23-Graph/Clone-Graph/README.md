<!-- <details><summary>Optimal Solution 1</summary>

Optimal Solution 1: TC = `O(2 ^ N)`, SC = `O(2 ^ N)` (considering stack space of recursion)

* We recursively find out all the subset sums of the given array. <br>
* We design a recursive function where we take in the the index and the current sum as parameters. <br>
* At each function call, we can either take the current index's element in our sum parameter or ignore it. <br>
* This generates all the subset sums. We push the sum in the answer array when the index hits the last point. <br>
	

Total Time Taken: `0.12 / 1.3`

Optimal Solution 2: TC â‰ˆ `O(N)`, SC = `O(N)`

* Create a copy of each node when it's visited and store a copy of it in hashmap.
* When an instance of a node is found in hashmap, push the mapped value.
* If an instance is not found, recursively make the new node.
