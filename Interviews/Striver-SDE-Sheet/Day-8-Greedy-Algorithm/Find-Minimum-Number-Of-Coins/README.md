Optimal Solution: TC = `O(10)`, SC = `O(10)`

* We can greedily take the highest denomination and check how many times the highest denomination can be given for the amount. <br>
* We then deduct the amount that the highest denomination compensated from the given amount. <br>
* We do this for all denominations.<br>
* The sum of count over all denominations is our answer. <br>
