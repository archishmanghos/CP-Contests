Optimal Solution: TC = `O(N x N)`, SC = `O(N x N)`

We can design a recursive solution and memoize the states. <br>
The parameters will consist of [x, y] co-ordinates of the cell. <br>
If the cell of the matrix is 3, we add the recursive functions in-case of path calculation and take the max of them incase of maximum adventure. <br>
