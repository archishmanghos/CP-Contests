Optimal Solution: TC = `O(N)`, SC = `O(1)`

> We notice that we don't actually need to calculate average for this problem. <br>
> We just need to find the maximum sum as it will automatically increase the average. <br>
> So, this problem got effectively reduced to maximum sum subarray problem which can be solved using sliding-window technique. <br>
