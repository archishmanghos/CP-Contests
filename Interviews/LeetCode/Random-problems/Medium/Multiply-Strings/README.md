<details><summary>Sub-Optimal Solution</summary>

Sub-Optimal Solution: TC = O(N x M + (N + M) x min(N, M)) , SC = O(min(N, M)) 

* Find the product just like elementary school maths and store product for each digit in a vector. <br>
* Iterate over the vector and calculate sum over each digit. <br>
* This will give us the final product. <br>
