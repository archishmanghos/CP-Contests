<details><summary>Sub-Optimal Solution</summary>

Sub-Optimal Solution: TC = O(9 x 9 x 3 x 3) , SC = O(30)  

* We traverse the sudoku, check for every 3 x 3 grids for their validity, check if the rows contain unique digits and also the same for the columns. <br>
* Although it may seem pure brute force and lot of for loops, the loops can be reduced a lot which is evident from my solution.<br>


Runtime: `27 ms`, faster than `74.70%`<br>
Memory Usage: `18.4 MB`, less than `62.95%`<br>
