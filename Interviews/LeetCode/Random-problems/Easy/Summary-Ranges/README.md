My Solution: TC = `O(NlogN)`, SC = `O(1)`

> This is a simple greedy range problem. We sort the array and greedily try to include the integers inside a single interval. The rest is converting the integer to string and appending to our string final array. <br> 
> NOTE: Take care of integer overflows.
