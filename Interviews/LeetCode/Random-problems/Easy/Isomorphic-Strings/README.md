Optimal Solution: TC = `O(N)`, SC = `O(count of unique characters)` 

- Same logic as [Leetcode 890](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/), Implementation is slightly different.
- Check out [my solution](https://github.com/archishmanghos/DSA-Contests/tree/master/Interviews/LeetCode/Random-problems/Medium/Find-and-Replace-Pattern) for Leetcode 890 and change according to the question.


Runtime: `10 ms`, faster than `56.98%`<br>
