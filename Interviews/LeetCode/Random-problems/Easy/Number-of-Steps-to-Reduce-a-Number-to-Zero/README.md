Optimal Solution: TC = `O(logN)`, SC = `O(1)`

* We divide the number by 2 till the number is greater than 1. <br>
* At each step, we check if the number is odd or not, if it's odd, we increase the steps count by 2, else we increase the steps count by 1. <br>
* The final count of steps is the answer. <br>
