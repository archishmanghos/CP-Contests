Optimal Solution: TC = `O(N)`, SC = `O(N)`

Since, we have to return indices, we need to store the array in a vector of pairs or something of that sort, so that when we sort the vector, we don't lose the indices. <br>
We sort the vector. <br>
We take 2 pointers, 1 pointing to the start of the vector and another to the end. <br>
We take the sum of the array values at pointer 1 and pointer 2. 3 cases may arise: <br>
> Case 1: The sum is equal to the target. In that case, we return the indices. <br>
> Case 2: The sum is less than the target. In that case, we increase the 1st pointer, so that the sum increases as the elements are in ascending order. <br>
> Case 3: The sum is more than the target. In that case, we decrease the 2nd pointer, so that the sum decreases as the elements are in ascending order. <br>
